ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Joe, a full-stack developer with a passion for web and mobile development. Originally from Columbia, SC, I graduated from 4Geeks Academy, where I honed my skills in JavaScript, React, Python, Flask, and SQL.

ðŸš€ With experience in creating projects using React and Flask, I'm currently delving into building an Ecommerce website using these technologies along with SQL.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal for 2024 is to expand my expertise in both front and backend development and secure a role as a web developer.

âœ¨ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I love strumming the guitar!

ðŸŒŸ I bring a motivated and team-oriented approach to my work, with a strong focus on quality and continuous improvement. I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn and adapt to the latest technological trends. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
